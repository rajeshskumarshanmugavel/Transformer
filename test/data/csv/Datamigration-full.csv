10449,Cindy.Hite@highlights.com,"I have been working with Mr. Huffman and JJ to find a way for the service desk folks here and at Honesdale to reset their admin passwords(a-) . Right now it is working if you use Active Directory Users and Computers. However , if you use Active Directory Administration Center it fails with “Insufficient  Rights”. It looks like this is a known bug in ADAC. We could apply the hotfix or apply one of the workarounds.  I am leaning towards just granting the “account restrictions” permissions.  This is easy to do and should have very little ramifications.     To work around this issue, perform one of the following methods:  • Use the ADUC MMC snap-in.  • Grant the ""Read account restrictions"" and ""Write account restrictions"" permissions to the user account.  Important Granting the ""Read account restrictions"" and ""Write account restrictions"" permissions to the user account will enable the user account to perform account configurations that may affect the security of the account and of the domain.    http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2577917    I added the Read/Write Account Restrictions   for          ""HFC\DSACE-Accounts-People-Manager"" and ""HFC\DSACE-Accounts-People Password Reset"" to the ""OU=Administrators,OU=Accounts,DC=HFC,DC=Corp"" OU.",Cindy.Hite@highlights.com,Network Services,Normal,Normal,Completed,Minor Change,Minor Change,,NULL,NULL,Modify delegation permission to allow Service desk folks to use the Active Directory Administration Center,Network Services,Network & Telephone,NULL,NULL,0,2014-05-29 13:20:15,2014-05-29 13:33:48,NULL,Network & Telephone,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

11029,Daniel.Garofano@highlights.com,"Historically, we've always used a Local Group Policy and then Intune Configuration Profile called ""Prohibit access to Control Panel and PC settings (User)"" which would block standard users from being able to launch the Control Panel or PC Settings menu. Generally, standard users don't have any reason to access Control Panel, but PC Settings causes some workflow issues and the requirement of someone from the Enterprise Service Desk to connect to the system and help configure items like Display or Sound settings from an administrator account. With Intune, we now have the ability to set a configuration profile to allow only specific sub menus in the PC Settings Menu, while hiding everything else. Control Panel won't technically be ""prohibited"" once we make this change, but standard users are unable to search within the Start Menu, use the Run dialogue, or run the Control Panel via other means, so it's essentially out of sight, out of mind. With this change implemented, standard users will be able to launch the Settings Manu and it will display sub-menus for Display and Sound settings, so standard users can configure their own monitor topologies, connect their own headsets and change output/input settings. This will reduce the time required to make these basic changes, since someone with administrator access won't be required.
